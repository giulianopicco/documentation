Expenses
========

Odoo **Expenses** streamlines the management of expenses.  After an employee submits their expenses
in Odoo, the expenses are reviewed by management and accounting teams. Once approved, payments can
then be processed and disbursed back to the employee for reimbursement(s).

Set expense categories
======================

The first step to track expenses is to configure the different types of expenses for the company
(managed as *expense categories* in Odoo). Each category can be as specific or generalized as
needed. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Configuration --> Expense Categories` to view the
current expensable categories in a default list view.

.. image:: expenses/categories.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Set expense costs on products.

To create a new expense category , click :guilabel:`New`. A *product* form will appear, with the
description field labeled :guilabel:`Product Name`.

.. note::
   Expense *categories* are managed like *products* in Odoo. The expense category form follows the
   standard *product* form in Odoo, and the information entered is similar. Expense *products* will
   be referred to as expense *categories* throughout this document since the main menu refers to
   these as :guilabel:`Expense Categories`.

Only two fields are required, the :guilabel:`Product Name` and the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure`.
Enter the :guilabel:`Product Name` in the field, and select the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure` from
the drop-down menu (most products will be set to :guilabel:`Units`).

.. tip::
   The *Sales* app is where specification on the units of measure are created and edited (e.g.
   units, miles, nights, etc.). Go to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings` and
   ensure `Units of Measure` is checked off in the `Product Catalog` section. Click on the
   :guilabel:`Units of Measure` internal link to view, create, and edit the units of measure. Refer
   to :doc:`this document </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/management/products/uom>` to
   learn more about units of measure and how to configure them.

.. image:: expenses/new-expense-product.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Set expense costs on products.

The :guilabel:`Cost` field on the product form is populated with a value of `0.00` by default. When
a specific expense should always be reimbursed for a particular price, enter that amount in the
:guilabel:`Cost` field. Otherwise, leave the :guilabel:`Cost` set to `0.00`, and employees will
report the actual cost when submitting an expense report.

.. example::
   Here are some examples for when to set a specific :guilabel:`Cost` on a product vs. leaving the
   :guilabel:`Cost` at `0.00`:

   - **Meals**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.00`. When an employee logs an expense for a meal, they
     enter the actual amount of the bill and will be reimbursed for that amount. An expense for a
     meal costing $95.23 would equal a reimbursement for $95.23.
   - **Mileage**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.30`. When an employee logs an expense for
     "mileage", they enter the number of miles driven, and are reimbursed 0.30 per mile they
     entered. An expense for 100 miles would equal a reimbursement for $30.00.
   - **Monthly Parking**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `75.00`. When an employee logs an expense for
     "monthly parking", the reimbursement would be for $75.00.
   - **Expenses**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.00`. When an employee logs an expense that is not
     a meal, mileage, or monthly parking, they use the generic :guilabel:`Expenses` product. An
     expense for a laptop costing $350.00 would be logged as an :guilabel:`Expenses` product, and
     the reimbursement would be for $350.00.

Select an :guilabel:`Expense Account` if using the Odoo *Accounting* app. It is recommended to check
with the accounting department to determine the correct account to reference in this field as it
will affect reports.

Set a tax on each product in the :guilabel:`Vendor Taxes` and :guilabel:`Customer Taxes` fields if
applicable. It is considered good practice to use a tax that is configured with :ref:`Tax Included
in Price <taxes/included-in-price>`. Taxes will be automatically configured if this is set.

.. _expenses/new:

Record expenses
===============

Manually create a new expense
-----------------------------

To record a new expense, begin in the main :menuselection:`Expenses` app dashboard, which presents
the default :guilabel:`My Expenses` view. This view can also be accessed from
:menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`.

First, click :guilabel:`New`, and then fill out the various fields on the form.

- :guilabel:`Description`: Enter a short description for the expense in the :guilabel:`Description`
  field. This should be short and informative, such as `lunch with client` or `hotel for
  conference`.
- :guilabel:`Category`: Select the expense category from the drop-down menu that most closely
  corresponds to the expense. For example, an airplane ticket would be appropriate for an expense
  :guilabel:`Catrgory` named :guilabel:`Air Travel`.
- :guilabel:`Total`: Enter the total amount paid for the expense in one of two ways:

  #. If the expense is for one single item/expense, and the category selected was for a single item,
     enter the cost in the :guilabel:`Total` field (the :guilabel:`Quantity` field is hidden).
  #. If the expense is for multiples of the same item/expense with a fixed price, the
     :guilabel:`Unit Price` is displayed. Enter the quantity in the :guilabel:`Quantity` field, and
     the total cost is automatically updated with the correct total ( the :guilabel:`Unit Price` X
     the :guilabel:`Quantity` = the total).

     .. example::
        In the case of mileage driven, for example, the :guilabel:`Unit Price` is populated as the
        cost *per mile*. Set the :guilabel:`Quantity` to the *number of miles* driven, and the total
        is calculated. Also, the word :guilabel:`Total` does not appear, the total cost simply
        appears below the :guilabel:`Quantity`.

- :guilabel:`Included Taxes`: If taxes were configured on the expense category, the tax percentage
  and the total tax appears automatically.

  .. note::
     When a tax is configured on an expense category, the :guilabel:`Included Taxes` value will
     update in real time as the :guilabel:`Total` or :guilabel:`Quantity` is updated.

- :guilabel:`Employee`: Using the drop-down menu, select the employee this expense is for.
- :guilabel:`Paid By`: Click the radio button to indicate who paid for the expense and should be
  reimbursed. If the employee paid for the expense (and should be reimbursed) select
  :guilabel:`Employee (to reimburse)`. If the company paid directly instead (e.g. if the company
  credit card was used to pay for the expense) select :guilabel:`Company`.
- :guilabel:`Bill Reference`: If there is any reference text that should be included for the
  expense, enter it in this field.
- :guilabel:`Expense Date`: Using the calendar module, enter the date the expense was incurred. Use
  the :guilabel:`< (left)` and :guilabel:`> (right)` arrows to navigate to the correct month, then
  click on the specific day to enter the selection.
- :guilabel:`Account`: Select the expense account that this expense should be logged on from the
  drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice`: If the expense is something that should be paid for by a
  customer, select the customer that will be invoiced for this expense from the drop-down menu. For
  example, if a customer wishes to have an on-site meeting, and agrees to pay for the expenses
  associated with it (such as travel, hotel, meals, etc.), then all expenses tied to that meeting
  would indicate that customer as the :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice`.
- :guilabel:`Analytic Distribution`: Select the account(s) the expense should be written against
  from the drop-down menu for either :guilabel:`Projects` and :guilabel:`Departments`, or both. To
  adjust the percentage for each analytic account, type in the percentage value next to the account.
- :guilabel:`Company`: If multiple companies are set-up, select the company this expense should be
  filed for from the drop-down menu. The current company will automatically populate this field.
- :guilabel:`Notes...`: If any notes are needed in order to clarify the expense, enter them in the
  notes field.

   :alt: A filled in expense form for a client lunch.

Attach a receipt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the expense is created, the next step is to attach a receipt. Click the :guilabel:`Attach
Receipt` button, and a file explorer appears. Navigate to the receipt to be attached, and click
:guilabel:`Open`. The new receipt is recorded in the chatter, and the number of receipts will appear
next to the :guilabel:`ðŸ“Ž(paperclip)` icon beneath the expense form. More than one receipt can be
attached to an individual expense, as needed. The number of receipts attached to the expense will be
noted on the paperclip icon.

.. image:: expenses/receipt-icon.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Attach a receipt and it appears in the chatter.

Automatically create new expenses from an email
-----------------------------------------------

Instead of individually creating each expense in the *Expenses* app, expenses can be automatically
created by sending an email to an email alias.

To do so, first, an email alias needs to be configured. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. Ensure :guilabel:`Incoming Emails` is checked off.

.. image:: expenses/email-alias.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create the domain alias by clicking the link.

.. note::
   If the domain alias needs to be set up, :guilabel:`Setup your domain alias` will appear beneath
   the incoming emails check box instead of the email address field. Refer to this documentation for
   setup instructions and more information: :doc:`/administration/maintain/domain_names`. Once the
   domain alias is configured, the email address field will be visible beneath the incoming emails
   section.

Next, enter the email address to be used in the email field, then click :guilabel:`Save`. Now that
the email address has been entered, emails can be sent to that alias to create new expenses without
having to be in the Odoo database.

To submit an expense via email, create a new email and enter the product's *internal reference* code
(if available) and the amount of the expense in the email subject. Next, attach the receipt to the
email. Odoo creates the expense by taking the information in the email subject and combining it with
the receipt.

To check an expense categories internal reference, go to :menuselection:`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Expense Categories`. If an internal reference is listed on the expense category,
it is listed in the **Internal Reference** column.

.. image:: expenses/ref.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Categories view.

To add an internal reference on an expense category, click on the category to call up the form.
Enter the :guilabel:`Internal Reference` in the field. Beneath the :guilabel:`Internal Reference`
field, this sentence appears: :guilabel:`Use this reference as a subject prefix when submitting by
email.`

.. image:: expenses/mileage-internal-reference.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Products view.

.. note::
   For security purposes, only authenticated employee emails are accepted by Odoo when creating an
   expense from an email. To confirm an authenticated employee email address, go to the employee
   card in the :guilabel:`Employees` app, and refer to the :guilabel:`Work Email` in the main field.

   .. image:: expenses/authenticated-email-address.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Create the domain alias by clicking the link.

.. example::
   If submitting an expense via email for a $25.00 meal during a work trip, the email subject would
   be `FOOD $25.00`.

   Explanation:

   - The :guilabel:`Internal Reference` for the expense category `Meals` is `FOOD`
   - The :guilabel:`Cost` for the expense is `$25.00`

Create an expense report
========================

When expenses are ready to submit (such as at the end of a business trip, or once a month), an
*expense report* needs to be created. Go to the main :menuselection:`Expenses` app dashboard, which
displays a default :guilabel:`My Expenses` view, or go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> My
Expenses --> My Expenses`.

Expenses are color coded by status. Any expense with a status of *to report* (expenses that still
need to be added to an expense report) the text appears in blue. All other statuses (to submit,
submitted, and approved) the text appears in black.

First, each individual expense for the report must be selected by clicking the check box next to
each entry, or quickly select all the expenses in the list by clicking the check box next to
:guilabel:`Expense Date`.

.. image:: expenses/create-report.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select the expenses to submit, then create the report.

Once the expenses have been selected, click the :guilabel:`Create Report` button. The new report
appears with all the expenses listed in the :guilabel:`Expense` tab. If there is a receipt attached
to an individual expense, a :guilabel:`ðŸ“Ž(paperclip)` icon appears next to the :guilabel:`Customer
to Reinvoice` and :guilabel:`Analytic Distribution` columns.

When the report is created, the date range for the expenses appears in the :guilabel:`Expense Report
Summary` field by default. It is recommended to edit this field with a short summary for each report
to help keep expenses organized. Enter a short description for the expense report (such as `Client
Trip NYC`, or `Repairs for Company Car`) in the :guilabel:`Expense Report Summary` field . Next,
select a :guilabel:`Manager` from the drop-down menu to assign a manager to review the report. If
needed, the :guilabel:`Journal` can be changed. Use the drop-down menu to select a different
:guilabel:`Journal`.

.. image:: expenses/expense-report-summary.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enter a short description and select a manager for the report.

If some expenses are not on the report that should be, they can still be added. Click :guilabel:`Add
a line` at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Expense` tab. A pop up appears with all the available
expenses that can be added to the report (a status of :guilabel:`To Submit`). Click the check box
next to each expense to add, then click :guilabel:`Select`. The items now appear on the report that
was just created. If a new expense needs to be added that does *not* appear on the list, click
:guilabel:`New` to create a new expense and add it to the report.

.. image:: expenses/add-an-expense-line.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Add more expenses to the report before submitting.

.. note::
   Expense reports can be created in one of three places:

   #. Go to the main :menuselection:`Expenses` app dashboard, also accessed by going to
      :menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`
   #. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Reports`
   #. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Expense Reports`

   In any of these views lick :guilabel:`New` to create a new expense report.

Submit an expense report
------------------------

When an expense report is completed, the next step is to submit the report to a manager for
approval. Reports must be individually submitted, and cannot be submitted in batches. Open the
specific report from the list of expense reports (if the report is not already open). To view all
expense reports, go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Reports`.

If the list is large, grouping the results by status may be helpful since only reports that have a
:guilabel:`To Submit` status need to be submitted, reports with an :guilabel:`Approved` or
:guilabel:`Submitted` status do not.

The :guilabel:`To Submit` expenses are easily identifiable not just from the :guilabel:`To Submit`
status, but the text appears in blue, while the other expenses text appears in black.

.. image:: expenses/expense-status.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Submit the report to the manager.

.. note::
   The status of each report is shown in the :guilabel:`Status` column on the right. If the
   :guilabel:`Status` column is not visible, click the :guilabel:`Additional Options (two dots)`
   icon at the end of the row, and check the box next to :guilabel:`Status`.

Click on a report to open it, then click :guilabel:`Submit To Manager`. After submitting a report,
the next step is to wait for the manager to approve it.

.. important::
   The :ref:`expenses/approve`, :ref:`expenses/post`, and :ref:`expenses/reimburse` sections are
   **only** for users with the *necessary rights*.

.. _expenses/approve:

Approve expenses
================

In Odoo, not just anyone can approve expense reportsâ€” only users with the necessary rights (or
permissions) can. This means that a user must have at least *Team Approver* rights for the
*Expenses* app. Employees with the necessary rights can review expense reports, and approve or
reject them, as well as provide feedback thanks to the integrated communication tool.

To see who has rights to approve, go to the main :menuselection:`Settings` app and click on
:guilabel:`Manage Users`.

.. note::
   If the *Settings* app is not available, then certain rights are not set on the account. In the
   :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab of a user's card in the :menuselection:`Settings` app, the
   :guilabel:`Administration` section (bottom right of the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab ) is set
   to one of three options:

   - :guilabel:`None (blank)`: The user cannot access the *Settings* app at all.
   - :guilabel:`Access Rights`: The user can only view the :guilabel:`User's & Companies` section of
     the *Settings* app.
   - :guilabel:`Settings`: The user has access to the entire *Settings* app with no restrictions.

   Please refer to :doc:`this document </applications/general/users/manage_users>` to learn more
   about managing users and their access rights.

Click on an individual to view their card, which displays the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab in the
default view. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Human Resources` section. Under :guilabel:`Expenses`,
there are four options:

- :guilabel:`None (blank)`: A blank field means the user has no rights to view or approve expense
  reports, and can only view their own.
- :guilabel:`Team Approver`: The user can only view and approve expense reports for their own
  specific team.
- :guilabel:`All Approver`: The user can view and approve any expense report.
- :guilabel:`Administrator`: The user can view and approve any expense report as well as access the
  reporting and configuration menus in the *Expenses* app.

Users who are able to approve expense reports (typically managers) can easily view all expense
reports. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Expense Reports`, and a list appears with all
expense reports that have a status of either :guilabel:`To Submit`, :guilabel:`Submitted`,
:guilabel:`Approved`, :guilabel:`Posted`,or :guilabel:`Done`. Expense reports with a status of
:guilabel:`Refused` are hidden in the default view.

.. image:: expenses/expense-reports-list.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Reports to validate are found on the Reports to Approve page.

When viewing expense reports, there is a panel of filters to chose from on the left side. The three
categories that the filters are applied on are :guilabel:`Status`, :guilabel:`Employee`, and
:guilabel:`Company`. To view only expense reports with a particular status, click the checkbox next
to the :guilabel:`Status` to display the expense reports with that status. Click the checkbox again
to hide the results. To view expense reports for a particular employee or company, click on the
employee name or company name in the :guilabel:`Employee` and :guilabel:`Company` sections.

Reports can be approved in two ways (individually or several at once) and refused only one way. To
approve multiple expense reports at once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports to
approve by clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to :guilabel:`Employee`
to select all reports in the list.

.. important::
   Only reports with a status of :guilabel:`Submitted` can be approved. It is recommended to only
   display the submitted reports by adjusting the :guilabel:`Status` filter on the left side by
   only having the :guilabel:`Submitted` filter checked off.

   If a report that is unable to be approved is selected, the :guilabel:`Approve Report` button
   **will not appear**, indicating there is a problem with the selected report(s).

Next, click the :guilabel:`Approve Report` button.

.. image:: expenses/approve-report.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Approve multiple reports by clicking the checkboxes next to each report.

To approve an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed view of that report. In this
view, several options are presented: :guilabel:`Approve`, :guilabel:`Report in Next Payslip`,
:guilabel:`Refuse`, or :guilabel:`Reset to draft`. Click :guilabel:`Approve` to approve the report.

If :guilabel:`Refuse` is clicked, a pop-up window appears. Enter a brief explanation for the refusal
in the :guilabel:`Reason to Refuse Expense` field, then click :guilabel:`Refuse`.

.. image:: expenses/refuse-expense.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Send messages in the chatter.

Team managers can easily view all the expense reports for their team members. While in the
:guilabel:`Expense Reports` view, click the drop-down arrow in the right-side of the search box, and
click on :guilabel:`My Team` in the :guilabel:`Filters` section. This presents all the reports for
the manager's team.

.. image:: expenses/my-team-filter.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select the My Team filter.

.. note::
   If more information is needed, such as a receipt is missing, communication is easy from the
   chatter. In an individual report, simply click :guilabel:`Send message` to open the message text
   box. Type in a message, tagging the proper person (if needed), and post it to the chatter by
   clicking :guilabel:`Send`.

   The message is posted in the chatter, and the person tagged will be notified via email of the
   message, as well as any followers. The only people that can be tagged in a message are
   *followers*. To see who is a follower, click on the :guilabel:`ðŸ‘¤ (person)` icon to display the
   followers of the expense.

   .. image:: expenses/chatter.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Send messages in the chatter.

.. _expenses/post:

Post expenses in accounting
===========================

Once an expense report is approved, the next step is to post the report to the accounting journal.
To view all expense reports, go to :menuselection:`Expenses --> Expense Reports`. To view only the
expense reports that have been approved and need to be posted, adjust the filters on the left
side so that only the :guilabel:`Approved` status is active (checked off).

.. image:: expenses/post-reports.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View reports to post by clicking on expense reports, then reports to post.

Just like approvals, expense reports can be posted in two ways (individually or several at once). To
post multiple expense reports at once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports to post by
clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to :guilabel:`Employee` to select
all reports in the list. Next, click :guilabel:`Post Entries`.

.. image:: expenses/post-entries.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Post multiple reports at a time from the Expense Reports view, with the Approved filter.

To post an individual report, click on a report to go to the detailed view of that report. In this
view, several options are presented: :guilabel:`Post Journal Entries`, :guilabel:`Report In Next
Payslip`, :guilabel:`Refuse`, or :guilabel:`Reset to Draft`. Click :guilabel:`Post Journal Entries`
to post the report.

If :guilabel:`Refuse` is clicked, a pop-up window appears. Enter a brief explanation for the refusal
in the :guilabel:`Reason to Refuse Expense` field, then click :guilabel:`Refuse`. Refused reports
can be viewed by going to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Expense Reports`, then adjusting the
filters on the left so that only :guilabel:`Refused` is selected. This will only show the refused
expense reports.

.. note::
   To post expense reports to an accounting journal, the user must have following access rights:

   - Accounting: Accountant or Adviser
   - Expenses: Manager

.. _expenses/reimburse:

Reimburse employees
===================

After an expense report is posted to an accounting journal, the next step is to reimburse the
employee. To view all expense reports to pay, go to :menuselection:`Expenses --> Expense Reports`.
To view only the expense reports that have been posted but the employee still needs to be
reimbursed, adjust the filters on the left side so that only the :guilabel:`Posted` status is active
(checked off).

.. image:: expenses/reports-to-pay.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View reports to pay by clicking on expense reports, then reports to pay.

Just like approvals and posting, expense reports can be paid in two ways (individually or several at
once). To pay multiple expense reports at once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports
to pay by clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to :guilabel:`Employee`
to select all reports in the list. Next, click :guilabel:`Register Payment`.

.. image:: expenses/register-payment.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Post multiple reports by clicking the checkboxes, clicking the gear, then post the entries.

A pop-up appears so the :guilabel:`Journal`, :guilabel:`Payment Method`, and :guilabel:`Payment
Date` can be modified, if needed. When the selections are correct, click :guilabel:`Create Payment`
to send the payment to the employee.

To pay an individual report, click on a report in the list view to go to a detailed view of that
report. Click :guilabel:`Register Payment` to pay the employee. A pop-up appears, but when paying an
individual expense report instead of several at once, more options appear in the pop-up. In addition
to the :guilabel:`Journal`, :guilabel:`Payment Method`, and :guilabel:`Payment Date` fields, a
:guilabel:`Recipient Bank Account`, :guilabel:`Amount`, and :guilabel:`Memo` field appear. Select
the employee's bank account from the drop-down menu to direct deposit the payment to their account.
When all other selections are correct, click :guilabel:`Create Payment` to send the payment to the
employee.

.. image:: expenses/two-payment-posting-options.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Different options appear when registering an individual expense report versus multiple
         expense reports at once.

Re-invoice expenses to customers
================================

If expenses are tracked on customer projects, expenses can be automatically charged back to the
customer. This is done by creating an expense report, then creating a sales order with the expensed
items on it. Then, managers approve the expense report, and the accounting department posts the
journal entries. Finally, the customer is invoiced.

Setup
-----

First, specify the invoicing policy for each expense category. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses
app --> Configuration --> Expense Categories`. Click on the expense category to open the expense
category form. Under the :guilabel:`Invoicing` section, click the radio button next to the desired
selection for :guilabel:`Re-Invoicing Expenses`. Options are :guilabel:`None`, :guilabel:`At cost`,
and :guilabel:`Sales price`.

:guilabel:`Re-Invoicing Expenses`:

- :guilabel:`None`: Expense category will not be re-invoiced.
- :guilabel:`At cost`: Expense category will invoice expenses at their real cost.
- :guilabel:`At sales price`: Expense category will invoice the price set on the sale order.

Create an expense
-----------------

First, when :ref:`creating a new expense <expenses/new>`, the correct information needs to be
entered in order to re-invoice a customer. Select the :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` from the
drop-down menu. Next, select the :guilabel:`Analytic Account` the expense will be posted to.

.. image:: expenses/reinvoice-expense.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Ensure the customer to be invoiced is called out on the expense.

Create a quote and sales order
------------------------------

In the :menuselection:`Sales` app, create a quote for the customer being invoiced, listing the
expense products. First, click :guilabel:`Create` to create a new quotation. Next, select the
:guilabel:`Customer` being invoiced for the expenses from the drop-down menu.

In the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a product`. In the :guilabel:`Product`
field, select the first item being invoiced from the drop-down menu, or type in the product name.
Then, update the :guilabel:`Quantity`, the :guilabel:`Delivered` quantity, and the :guilabel:`Unit
Price` if needed. Repeat this for all products being invoiced. When all the products have been added
to the quote, click :guilabel:`Confirm` and the quotation becomes a sales order.

.. image:: expenses/expenses-salesorder.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create and confirm the sales order with the expenses listed as products.

Once the quote turns into a sales order, a :guilabel:`Delivered` column appears. The delivered
quantity must be updated for each item. Click on the `0.000` field for each product, and enter the
delivered quantity. When all delivered quantities have been entered, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Validate and post expenses
--------------------------

Only employees with permissions (typically managers or supervisors) can :ref:`approve expenses
<expenses/approve>`. Before approving an expense report, ensure the :guilabel:`Analytic Account` is
set on every expense line of a report. If an :guilabel:`Analytic Account` is missing, click
:guilabel:`Edit` and select the correct account from the drop-down menu, then click
:guilabel:`Approve` or :guilabel:`Refuse`.

The accounting department is typically responsible for :ref:`posting journal entries
<expenses/post>`. Once an expense report is approved, it can then be posted.

Invoice expenses
----------------

Once the quote has turned into a sales order, and the expense report has been approved, it is time
to invoice the customer. Go to :menuselection:`Sales app --> To Invoice --> Orders to Invoice` to
view the sales orders ready to be invoiced.

Next, find the sales order related to the expense report, click into it, and then click
:guilabel:`Create Invoice` and a :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up window appears. Select if the
invoice is a :guilabel:`Regular invoice`, :guilabel:`Down payment (percentage)`, or :guilabel:`Down
payment (fixed amount)` by clicking the radio button next to the selection. For either down payment
options, enter the amount (fixed or percentage) in the :guilabel:`Down Payment Amount` field.
Finally, click either :guilabel:`create and view invoice` or :guilabel:`create invoice`.
